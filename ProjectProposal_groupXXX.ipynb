    "Clickbait is a term used to describe the practice of using sensationalized or exaggerated titles in order to grab the attention of an audience, often by appealing to their emotions or curiosity. These attention-grabbing tactics are employed with the intention of enticing individuals to click on a particular link or engage with the content, sometimes leading to disappointment when the actual content fails to live up to the expectations that was created. By engaging in clickbait, creators can drive more traffic into their site/video which in turn earns them more advertising money, clicks, or conversions. The term was coined back in December 2006 by Jay Geiger in a blog post where ‘click’ refers to clicking on a link and ‘bait’ referring to reeling in viewers like a fish on a hook. An example of clickbait is “I can’t believe what this celebrity did in public!” The exaggerated nature of the title piques curiosity and entices individuals to click on the link to find out more, even though the actual content could simply be them grocery shopping or picking up trash and throwing it away. \n",
    "\n",
    "Previous research on ‘clickbait’ has focused on detecting and preventing clickbait on online news media [^Chakraborty2016] and investigating the impact of having clickbait news article titles on readers [^Scacco2016]. In the former, they found that online news media outlets heavily rely on revenue from clicks, leading to intense competition for reader attention. To attract clicks, outlets use catchy clickbait headlines that often fail to meet readers' expectations. Thus, researchers have developed methods to automatically detect clickbait and created a browser extension that warns readers about clickbait and allows them to block unwanted content. Through extensive experiments, the clickbait detection and personalized blocking approaches achieved high accuracy, with 93% accuracy in detecting clickbait and 89% accuracy in blocking it. While in the latter, researchers examined the effects of headlines with varying levels of uncertainty on reactions to political news. The researchers investigated whether traditional, forward-reference, or question-based headlines elicited negative reactions, negative expectations, and reduced intentions to engage with the news article.\n",
    "\n",
    " In our work, we seek to address any possible shared characteristics between clickbait video titles from a particular YouTube channel: 5-Minute Craft where they showcase various do-it-yourself (DIY) projects and crafts that can be completed in under 5 minutes. Similar to research done by [^Jung2012], in “Click Me…! The influence of clickbait on user engagement in social media and the role of digital nudging”, they examined the factors that influenced the effectiveness of clickbait headlines in driving user engagement on social media and found headlines that are emotionally charged, mysterious, or offer a sense of urgency are more likely to be clicked on. However, in our paper we aim to focus on a specific analysis of the shared characteristics of clickbait video titles used by the YouTube channel 5-Minute Craft. By examining the video titles of this particular channel, we intend to investigate whether they employ similar strategies as those identified in previous research, such as utilizing emotionally charged language, creating curiosity or mystery, or generating a sense of urgency to attract viewers' attention and engagement.\n",

Privacy is not a large concern, the data collected from youtube does not include any personal information whatsoever, only analytics regarding viewership and the video itself. There may be bias in the way the youtube algorithm presents videos, where uploaders could catalyze viewership through clickbait, thus youtube highly favors clickbait when serving videos. \n",
